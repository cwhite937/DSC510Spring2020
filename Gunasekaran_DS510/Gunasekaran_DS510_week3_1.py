# Assignment :
#           Using comments, create a header at the top of the program indicating the purpose of the program, assignment number, and your name. Use the SIUE Style Guide as a reference.
#           Display a welcome message for your user.
#           Retrieve the company name from the user.
#           Retrieve the number of feet of fiber optic cable to be installed from the user.
#           Calculate the installation cost of fiber optic cable by multiplying the total cost as the number of feet times by price by feet purchased.
#               Using the default value of $0.87 calculate the total expense.
#               If the user purchases more than 100 feet they are charged $0.80 per foot.
#               If the user purchases more than 250 feet they will be charged $0.70 per foot.
#               If they purchase more than 500 feet, they will be charged $0.50 per foot.
#               Print a receipt for the user including the company name, number of feet of fiber to be installed, the calculated cost, and total cost in a legible format.
# Desc :    Program to calculate total cost of fiber cable installation
# Usage :
#           The program prompts the user for company name, required feet of fiber optical cable to be installed
#           The program will calculate the cost of prints the receipt for the user
